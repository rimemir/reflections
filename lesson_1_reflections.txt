How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed only those parts of the file that are different so that searching for the bug was easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I could make changes without worrying about breaking something, I could test ideas easily, branch the code
with different implementations etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro is commits are done only after a full logical change is made, never in the middle of changing a file.
Con is necessity for more decision making done by the user, in choosing the right time to commit, and the possibility
to forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they are used in different contexts, for different tasks.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use git log to see entire history of files and find the ID of commits, then use git diff and IDs to compare commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because I know that whatever I do, it is easy to find a bug if it's there, and easy to revert changes.
