What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git folder gets created which holds the metadata about the repository.

How is the staging area different from working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

You can separate commits even if you worked on multiple files without commiting.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If I do more than one logical change without commiting, I can stage and commit each
change separately.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

Experimental change, testing multiple implementations, etc. I can make the different changes to
the same file and compare them.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show each commit's parent so it's easy to trace each branch.
