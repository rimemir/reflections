When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my code with other people, or collaborate on a project. Also, as a backup, it's good to have a remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having GitHub automatically stay up
to date with your remote repository?

I might be working on something locally that I didn't push yet. I don't want GitHub changing that automatically.
